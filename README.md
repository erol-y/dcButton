# dcButton
A dual case (role) wxButton implementation
#
This is a small library derives from wxButton that you can implement buttons like start/stop play/pause etc.

You should have wxWidgets v2.9.1 at least to use

Installation
------------
There are only two files:

*  /include/dcbutton.h
*  /src/dcbutton.cpp

Just copy those files to your project.

Another option is linking as static library.

There is a sample app in samples directory to demonstrate how to work.

I have added simple Makefile for both library and sample.

Also, Code::Blocks project files exist.
